    "These questions fall under the category of data summarization and in particular text summarization. Broadly speaking, there are two different approaches which one can take for summarizing text: extractive summarization where the summary of the document is a part of the document and astractive summarization where the summary is not a part of the document and is generated by a learning model. \n",
